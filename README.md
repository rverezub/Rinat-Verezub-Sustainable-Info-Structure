Self Critique

My approach to creating this project was to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to design a website that is clear and intuitive. I also ensured accessibility by incorporating techniques such as “alt” attributes for images, so that users relying on screen readers can understand the context provided by these images. Additionally, a functional navigation element fixed to the bottom of the page, with a :hover effect, ensures that all users can navigate the pages effectively.

With more time, I would have implemented additional accessibility features, such as a dark mode theme, to reduce eye strain and support extended use (especially considering that my primary user base, university students, often work late into the night).
